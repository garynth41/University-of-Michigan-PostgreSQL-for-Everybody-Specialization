# Database Architecture, Scale, and NoSQL with Elasticsearch


# About this Course
In this final course, you will explore database architecture, PostgreSQL, and various scalable deployment configurations. You will see how PostgreSQL implements basic CRUD operations and indexes, and review how transactions and the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) requirements are implemented. 

Youâ€™ll learn to use Elasticsearch NoSQL, which is a common NoSQL database and a supplement to a relational database to high-speed search and indexing. We will examine Elasticsearch as an example of a BASE-style (Basic Availability, Soft State, Eventual Consistency) database approach, as well as compare and contrast the advantages and challenges associated with ACID and BASE databases.

# WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
* nderstand PostgreSQL architecture; analyze and compare SQL and NoSQL
* ompare and contrast ACID and BASE style architectures and databases
* reate and utilize an Elasticsearch index in different contexts
